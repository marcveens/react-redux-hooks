# React + Redux + Hooks tryout
There are a couple of changes made to the way of working:
- No use of classes anymore, only functional components;
- Now using custom hooks instead of higher order components;
- Created some base templates for actions and reducers, makes it easier to create simple fetch components.
- Using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com) instead of SCSS/CSS
